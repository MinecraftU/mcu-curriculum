## Creative Server

This is a vanilla Minecraft server. This server can be joined from default Minecraft launcher or MultiMC as long as they are running version 1.16.2. We suggest using [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/) to create a 1.16.2 "instance" of Minecraft to connect to the server.

* Server address: **mcucreative.mcph.co**

This is a whitelisted server. To be added to the server email your username to info@minecraftu.org. 

## ComputerCraft Survival Server

This is a modded server requiring the [ComputerCraft](http://www.computercraft.info/) mod.

The easiest way to set up Minecraft to connect to this server is to install [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/), then drag the 1.8.9 ZIP file downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iFEHelj_f6AewnWqjkmtoQWgSm-0kJyt?usp=sharing) into the MultiMC window.

* Server address: **mcucc.mcph.co**

## Modded 1.12.2 Survival Server

This is a modded server that includes the following mods:

* [Cooking for Blockheads](http://blay09.net/mods/cookingforblockheads/?page=cookingforblockheads)

* [Switch Bow Mod](http://www.9minecraft.net/switch-bow-mod/)

The modpack also includes client-side mods:

* Inventory Tweaks
* JourneyMap
* OptiFine

We created this server to just have a bit more fun with the mods available on 1.12. Cooking for Blockheads and Pam's HarvestCraft combine to create quite a culinary experience within Minecraft. Switch Bow because who doesn't like better ranged weapons?

This is a survival server. Mobs are on.

The easiest way to set up Minecraft to connect to this server is to install [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/), then drag the 1.12.2 ZIP file downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iFEHelj_f6AewnWqjkmtoQWgSm-0kJyt?usp=sharing) into the MultiMC window.
