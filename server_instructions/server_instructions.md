## Creative Server

This is a vanilla Minecraft server. This server can be joined from default Minecraft, MultiMC or the Vanilla Technic Modpack as long as they are running version 1.13.2.

* Server address: **mcucreative.mcph.co**
* Minecraft version: 1.13.2

This is a whitelisted server. To be added to the server email your username to info@minecraftu.org. 

Since 1.13.2 is not the most recent version of Minecraft (which the standard Minecraft application from Microsoft will be running), we suggest using [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/) to create a 1.13.2 "instance" of Minecraft to connect to the server.

## ComputerCraft Survival Server

This is a modded server requiring the [ComputerCraft](http://www.computercraft.info/) mod.

Install Minecraft and ComputerCraft using the [instructions in Level 4](https://github.com/MinecraftU/mcu-curriculum/blob/master/level_4/section_1.md#installing-computercraft) or by installing the [Minecraft U modpack on Technic](https://www.technicpack.net/modpack/mcu.743668). 

* Server address: **mcucc.mcph.co**
* Minecraft version: 1.8.9
* ComputerCraft version: 1.7.9 (requires Forge)

This is a whitelisted server. To be added to the server email your username to info@minecraftu.org. This server is recommended for students who have completed Level 4 of the Minecraft U curriculum or are familiar with ComputerCraft. It is a survival world.
