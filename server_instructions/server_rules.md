## MCU Servers

<img src='images/mcu1.png' style='width:200px; float:right'>
Only MinecraftU students and staff, plus a very few vetted outside players, are allowed on the MCU servers. Do not ask for friends and siblings who have not been to MinecraftU to be added to the server.

This is all included as a part of your experience at Minecraft U, and you may continue to play on the server indefinitely. Every action on the server is logged.

Access to the camp server is contingent on behavior guidelines just like those in real life. Anything you wouldn't do to someone else in real life, you should not do on the server.

1. No griefers. [A griefer is a player in a multiplayer video game who deliberately irritates and harasses other players within the game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griefer). This includes causing damage to other players, damaging existing structures/contraptions and stealing.
1. It bears repeating: No stealing. You wouldn't just walk into someone else's house and take things out of their closet. Similarly, you may not remove things from other player's chests or houses without consequences. The only exceptions to this are chests marked with a sign as community chests, and food in the case of emergency.
1. No bad language.
1. No raging or rage quitting. Even if not intended as raging, all caps chatting may be interpreted as such.
1. Fill creeper holes and repair any other damage done by creeper blasts. (This isn't really applicable at the moment given mobs are disabled on the surface.)
1. Replant community crops, re-breed community animals and leave as much behind in community chests as you take out.
1. Only play on the server with your own account.
1. No student communication with admins outside of class, the server or the minecraftu forums (forum link forthcoming). Emailing or instant messaging admins is not allowed. All outside communication must occur via a parent.

Violations of any of these rules will result in the following, escalated as needed:

1. Verbal warning through chat.
1. If immediately reachable, warning to a parent.
1. Kick.
1. Indefinite ban. Length determined after discussion with a parent.
1. Permanent ban. Reversible only through appeal.
