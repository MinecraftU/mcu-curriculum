### Key Vocabulary

* Ores
* Iron
* Gold
* Diamond
* Redstone
* Lapis Lazuli
* Emerald
* Nether Quartz
* Strip Mine
* Smelt
* Ingot

### Exercises

Once a student can move around the Minecraft environment and craft basic items, they can start to learn basic mining techniques in creative mode. They could also begin practicing survival mode with the difficulty set to Peaceful.

Explain where diamonds are found (see Level 2, Section 3) and see if they can find diamonds. Encourage them to gather other ores while they are searching for diamonds. See who can collect the most ores in a 30-minute timespan.

Be sure to explain what types of pickaxes are required to mine certain ores (e.g. an iron pickaxe is required for diamond, a diamond pickaxe for obsidian).

Explain how to smelt ores into their respective ingots, then what tools, weapons, armor, and other items become available once they have the ingots in their inventory.
