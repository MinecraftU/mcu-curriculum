# Advanced Adventuring and Generated Structures

A generated structure is a structure that is generated when the world is created and appears artifical. For example, villages, mineshafts, and shipwrecks are all generated structures. 

It can be very useful to find these structures, as they can contain useful things like loot chests (which can contain useful items) and monster spawners (for mob farms). 

This section will cover a few structures that could be useful to you. For more information on all structures, check [the wiki](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Generated_structures).
