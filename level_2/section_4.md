# Section 4: Fighting Mobs

A mob, or mobile entity, is defined by the Minecraft Wiki as "an AI-driven game entity resembling a living creature." 

Mobs can be separated into 3 categories: 
1. Passive mobs, which don't attack you
2. Neutral mobs, which try to attack you only if you attack them
3. Hostile mobs, or monsters, which will always try to attack you. 

Many neutral and hostile mobs may be hard to fight, so this section will teach some mob fighting strategies. If you want more detail about how to fight a specific mob, [see this tutorial](https://www.kodeclik.com/how-to-kill-mobs-minecraft/).

## Tools

### Melee Weapons
You generally want to use the best sword you can get to maximize your damage. Swords go from worst to best like this: gold, wood, stone, iron, diamond, netherite. If you are good at aiming, using axes is a better alternative to swords until you get an iron sword. To do damage with a sword, simply left click on the mob you want to attack.

### The Shield
A shield will block all damage from most mobs when used by holding right cilck. This makes it a very useful item, so you should get one once you have the iron for it. Put it in your offhand for easiest use.

### Ranged Weapons
Ranged weapons like bows and crossbows can be very useful against some mobs that you might want to stay away from, like skeletons or creepers.

## General Strategies

### Critical Hitting
Using a sword while falling (after jumping) will do more damage than usual. This is called a critical hit. If the mob you are fighting is pretty slow, definitely use this strategy.
