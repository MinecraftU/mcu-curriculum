# Level 2 Appendix 3

## Skin Design

This section is pretty straightforward thanks to the great tools at [Miners Need Cool Shoes](http://www.needcoolshoes.com/). Go to needcoolshoes.com and import your skin or go to the gallery and pick a new one to tweak. Then edit that skin using their editing tools! You can download the png file or change your skin right from the site. You can even combine skins by loading multiple skins as layers in the editing tool.

## Auto-smelters

The concept behind an auto-smelter is pretty simple, actually: smelt a chest full of materials automatically. The build in its most basic is this: Chest (with materials) feeds into a hopper, which in turn feeds into the furnace, then into another hopper, then into the chest with the final product.

Think of ways to improve upon this design by making it more efficient, easier to load with raw materials or have more capacity.
