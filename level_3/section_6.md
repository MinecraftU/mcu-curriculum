## Automatic Farming

Farming isn't exactly difficult, and can be quite relaxing, but if you wanted to speed things up a bit there is a simple redstone contraption you can construct to automatically harvest your crops.

Water will flow 8 blocks, which is an important fact to know for many purposes. This farm will use water flowing downhill over the crops to automatically harvest them and drop them into hoppers, and then a central chest where you can pick up the foodstuffs.

Create a new creative world for this exercise.

First we'll set up the irrigation system for our farm by creating a canal down the center of our farming area. Both levels are eight blocks long, but the water starts at the second block so that it will flow off the end of the first level and down the second level.

Next cover the irrigation canal (using whatever block you want) and create the farm plots next to the canal:

Now create walls along the side of your plots. These will keep the water from flowing over the sides.

Now we'll place dispensers along the top of our farm. These will dispense the water that will harvest our crops and carry them down to the bottom of the farm.

To power the dispensers, you'll need redstone repeaters, redstone and a button, like so:

Place a bucket of water in each dispenser. The nice thing about this setup is the water buckets will remain full even after the dispenser dispenses the water. Plant crops of your choice. Here we've planted some carrots on the left and potatoes on the right:

Now we need to get the collection system in place. Place a chest at the bottom-center of your farm, directly in front of where the irrigation canal stops. Then place hoppers on either side of the chest. To do so take a hopper and then shift-click on the side of the chest to place the hopper. Do the same on the side of the hopper with another hopper. Now everything falling into these four hoppers will go into the chest in the center:

Now we have to wait for our crops to grow, but in creative we have a shortcut. Go ahead and take some bonemeal in your hand and right-click on your crops until they're fully grown.

To harvest, go press the button connected to the hoppers. The water will flow down over your crops, harvesting them and carrying them down to the hoppers.

When all the items have flowed down into the hoppers, press the button to stop the water flow, and replant!
