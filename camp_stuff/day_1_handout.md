# Welcome to Minecraft U!

Minecraft game mechanics are incredibly analogous to engineering. We focus on teaching problem solving and programming techniques in a safe, encouraging ecosystem centered around Minecraft. We hope your child has a great week with us, learns a great deal and has loads of fun!

There is one critical component to your child's enjoyment of this week and their use of their skills after the camp: a Minecraft account. While Minecraft is available on many platforms (such as iOS, Android, Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch), we focus on the PC (Windows, Mac or Linux) version because it provides what we need to teach both computer skills and coding. Each platform requires a separate account, so an account created on a different platform will not work on the PC. However, the PC version is good forever, no matter which computer you play Minecraft on! Minecraft is currently $26.95 and is available at [minecraft.net](https://www.minecraft.net/).

Once your child has an account, they will need the email and password for the account and we will need their Minecraft username. You can email all this information to info@minecraftu.org.
