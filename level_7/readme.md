## Minecraft U Level 7: Adventure Camp

![](images/level7.png)

How do tech companies like Apple, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft develop successful products? With people who know how to think creatively about technology. That's what Adventure Camp is all about—how to create ideas and put them to work with technology. We will use Minecraft as our playground because it is friendly and easy to use, but still sophisticated enough to use as an exploratory launching pad for these concepts. Over the course of the camp, students will learn about worldbuilding, product design and work management. Students will practice a design sprint, prototyping, user testing, iteration, and Kanban—all tools and methods that real software teams use to create the products you use every day.

This camp is an advanced course that will give campers hands-on software development experience, within the context of Minecraft, and teach them to push the boundaries of both their creative and technical ability. The curriculum introduces students to the project planning and implementation process as they work collaboratively on the design of a virtual world and user experience.

We run Adventure Camp like a web development team. Adventure Camp campers will develop their own modpack and map. They will work through a typical software design and development cycle, utilizing techniques such as design sprints, prototyping, user testing, iteration, and Kanban. Experience with these real-world tools is an excellent introduction to the processes that real software development teams would implement.

The best software product teams are a cross-functional mix of visionaries, creatives, detailed designers, technical experts, and organized project managers. Our Adventure Campers do all of the above! The team will make a fairly large and challenging map, with complex features such as a hub, and intricate game mechanics.
