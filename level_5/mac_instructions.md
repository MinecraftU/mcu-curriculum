### Install IntelliJ

We want to run the mods from an IDE. IDE stands for [Integrated Development Environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) and will allow you to edit, debug and run your mods. We're going to use an IDE called IntelliJ.

[Download the Community edition of IntelliJ here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) and install it.
