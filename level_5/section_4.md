# Making basic items

In this section, we will be referencing `mbe10_item_simple`. Our simple item is a frog. As always, read the README.md file in that directory, and then run the MinecraftByExample project and find the frog item and observe its use and behaviors.

Next, look at `ItemSimple.java`.

```java
public class ItemSimple extends Item
{
  public ItemSimple()
  {
    final int MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_FROGS = 6;
    this.setMaxStackSize(MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_FROGS);
    this.setCreativeTab(CreativeTabs.MISC);
  }
}
```

You'll notice here that again we're extending a class, this time the `Item` class. 

>Basic items that need no special functionality (think sticks or sugar) donâ€™t need custom classes. You can simply instantiate Item and call its various setters to set some simple properties.

[Forge docs](https://mcforge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/items/items/#advanced-items)

There are just a couple of lines of code in this class, one to set the maximum stack size. `MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_FROGS` is a _constant_, and the value passed into the `setMaxStackSize` must be represented this way. <!-- why? --> Constants are almost always represented with all caps.

The second method, `setCreativeTab`, sets the tab in which the item will appear in Creative mode.

To define the model for the item, go to `resources/assets/minecraftbyexample/modes/item/mbe10_item_simple.json`. You'll notice this is a large JSON file, but relatively readable. There are different _objects_ representing each state of the texture. An object in JSON is a group of key-value pairs, such as this:

```json
"firstperson_righthand": {
  "rotation": [ -25, -90, 0 ],
  "translation": [ 1.13, 3.20, 1.13 ],
  "scale": [ 0.68, 0.68, 0.68 ]
}
```

The keys in this JSON file are relatively easy to reason about. The above JSON object represents the item being held in the right hand while in first person. Let's look at a couple others:

```json
"firstperson_lefthand": {
  "rotation": [ 335, 90, 0 ],
  "translation": [ 1.13, 3.20, 1.13 ],
  "scale": [ 0.68, 0.68, 0.68 ]
},
"gui": {
  "rotation": [ 0, 0, 0 ],
  "translation": [ 0.00, 0.00, 0.00 ],
  "scale": [ 1.00, 1.00, 1.00 ]
},
```

You can see the rotation numbers change when in the left hand, and in the GUI the rotation numbers are 0. The same for if you were to throw the frog item on the ground:

```json
"ground": {
  "rotation": [ 0, 0, 0 ],
  "translation": [ 0.00, 4.00, 0.00 ],
  "scale": [ 0.60, 0.60, 0.60 ]
}
```

# Extending an existing item

In this section, we will be referencing `mbe10_tool_simple`. It extends `ItemPickaxe`. With `mbe10_item_simple`, we simply created an item that does nothing. Now we want to create a new pickaxe, so we'll _inherit_ all the characteristics from the `ItemPickaxe` object.

Look at `mbe10_tool_simple/ToolSimple.java`:

```java
public class ToolSimple extends ItemPickaxe 
{
  public ToolSimple(ToolMaterial material) {
    super(material);
    this.setCreativeTab(CreativeTabs.MISC);
  }
  
}
```

To understand the parameters passed into the `ToolSimple` method, look in `StartupCommon.java`:

```java
final Item.ToolMaterial TOOL_MATERIAL = Item.ToolMaterial.STONE;
toolSimple = (ToolSimple)(new ToolSimple(TOOL_MATERIAL));
```

You can see that the _material_ is set to stone. Finally, in `StartupClientOnly.java` you can see where the model and item texture are defined:

```java
ModelResourceLocation itemBlockModelResourceLocation = new ModelResourceLocation("minecraftbyexample:mbe10_tool_simple", "inventory");
```

So this is going to be a stone pickaxe but with a new name and texture. Run your project and observe the characteristics of this pickaxe.

Finally, let's change the material so that it's not just using all of stone's characteristics. We will need to create our own `ToolMaterial`. The ToolMaterial object consists of:

 A ToolMaterial has:

* A name (String) -- This should be the same as the variable name.
* A harvestLevel (int) -- Which blocks are mineable. Vanilla blocks range between 0 and 3. Examples:
    * Wood: 0
    * Stone: 1
    * Iron: 2
    * Diamond: 3
    * Gold: 0
* The max durability (int) -- How many times the tool can be used. Examples:
    * Wood: 59
    * Stond: 131
    * Iron: 250
    * Diamond: 1561
    * Gold: 32
* The mining speed (float) -- How fast the tool is. Examples:
    * No tool: 1.0f
    * Wood: 2.0f
    * Stone: 4.0f
    * Iron: 6.0f
    * Diamond: 8.0f
    * Gold: 12.0f
* The damage (float) -- How much damage it does against entities. Examples:
    * Wood: 0.0f
    * Stone: 1.0f
    * Iron: 2.0f
    * Diamond: 3.0f
    * Gold: 0.0f
* The enchantability (int) -- How good the enchants are. Examples:
    * Wood: 15
    * Stone: 5
    * Iron: 14
    * Diamond: 10
    * Gold: 22

Let's make our new tool the best of all worlds, the harvest level, durability and damage of diamond with the speed of gold. We'll define the ToolMaterial `StartupCommon` exactly where it is defined now. Modify the definition of `TOOL_MATERIAL`:

```java
final Item.ToolMaterial TOOL_MATERIAL = EnumHelper.addToolMaterial("TOOL_MATERIAL", 3, 1561, 12.0f, 3.0f, 22);
toolSimple = (ToolSimple)(new ToolSimple(TOOL_MATERIAL));
```

Notice this uses a new method called `EnumHelper`. This is a part of Forge that we need to import at the top of our file. In the imports section add:

```java
import net.minecraftforge.common.util.EnumHelper;
```

Now our pickaxe has the durability of a diamond pickaxe and the speed of a gold pickaxe. Try it out! To overpower your pickaxe, crank up the values passed into `addToolMaterial`, e.g:

```java
final ToolMaterial TUTORIALMATERIAL = EnumHelper.addToolMaterial("TUTORIALMATERIAL", 3, 2048, 13f, 4.0f, 30);
```

# Recipes

Now we need to make our new blocks and items useful by creating some recipes! There are two types of recipes we can create: shapeless and shaped. Shapeless recipes (such as making wooden planks from wood) don't require the items to be in any specific orientation to work. Shaped recipes (such as making a pickaxe or shovel) require blocks to be in specific locations for the recipe to function.

### Shapeless recipes

First, let's make a shapeless recipe.

### Shaped recipes

Next, let's make a shaped recipe. Shaped recipes group the rows of items using letters to represent the type of block. For example, the recipe for TNT would be: `("xyx", "yxy", "xyx", 'x', new ItemStack(Materials.sulphur), 'y', new ItemStack(Blocks.sand))` where `x` corresponds to sulphur (the name for gunpowder in the game code) and `y` corresponds to sand. Pay attention to the double-quotes for the letters representing the recipe shape and the single-quotes for the letters representing the items in the recipe.

> Note: when we leave out the size of the ItemStack, the game will assume a size of 1.

## Smelting recipes

Smelting recipes are very similar and only require a slightly different function call.
